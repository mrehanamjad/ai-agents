React.js is a powerful, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Meta and a massive community of developers. This crash course will take you from the fundamental concepts to building a functional application.
________________
1. What is React?
React is often called a framework, but it is technically a library. It focuses on the "View" layer of an application. The two biggest selling points are:
* Components: Small, reusable pieces of UI (like a button or a navigation bar).
* Declarative Syntax: You describe what the UI should look like based on the current state, and React handles updating the DOM to match.

2. Essential Prerequisites
Before diving in, ensure you are comfortable with:
* HTML/CSS: Semantic tags and Flexbox/Grid.
* Modern JavaScript (ES6+): Arrow functions, Destructuring, Spread operator, and Template literals.
* NPM/Node.js: Installed on your system to manage packages.
________________
3. Setting Up Your First Project
The modern way to start a React project is using Vite. It is significantly faster than the older create-react-app.
1. Open your terminal and run:
Bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react

2. Navigate into the folder: cd my-react-app
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Start the dev server: npm run dev

4. JSX: JavaScript XML
JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript. It makes the code more readable and visual.
Key Rules of JSX:
   * You must return a single parent element (or use a Fragment: <> ... </>).
   * Use className instead of class.
   * Use curly braces {} to embed JavaScript variables or expressions.


JavaScript




function Welcome() {
 const name = "Developer";
 return (
   <div className="container">
     <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
     <p>Today is {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>
   </div>
 );
}

________________
5. Components & Props
Components are functions that return JSX. Props (short for properties) are how you pass data from a parent component to a child.
Parent Component:


JavaScript




import Profile from './Profile';

function App() {
 return (
   <Profile name="Alice" job="Engineer" />
 );
}

Child Component (Profile.jsx):


JavaScript




function Profile(props) {
 return (
   <div>
     <h2>{props.name}</h2>
     <p>Role: {props.job}</p>
   </div>
 );
}

________________
6. State & Hooks (useState)
State is data that changes over time. When state updates, React re-renders the component to show the new data. We use the useState Hook to manage this.


JavaScript




import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
 // count = current value, setCount = function to update it
 const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

 return (
   <div>
     <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
     <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
       Increase
     </button>
   </div>
 );
}

________________
7. Handling Side Effects (useEffect)
The useEffect Hook allows you to perform "side effects" like fetching data, manually changing the DOM, or setting up subscriptions.


JavaScript




import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function DataFetcher() {
 const [data, setData] = useState([]);

 useEffect(() => {
   fetch('https://api.example.com/items')
     .then(res => res.json())
     .then(json => setData(json));
 }, []); // Empty array means this runs ONLY once on mount
}

________________
8. Lists and Keys
To render multiple items, we use the JavaScript .map() method. You must always provide a unique key prop to help React track which items changed.


JavaScript




const users = [
 { id: 1, name: 'John' },
 { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }
];

function UserList() {
 return (
   <ul>
     {users.map(user => (
       <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
     ))}
   </ul>
 );
}
